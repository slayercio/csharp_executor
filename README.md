# FiveM C# Executor
A lightweight **C# executor for FiveM**.

This project allows you to load and execute managed assemblies `(.NET / C#)` directly inside the FiveM environment.

It is a working executor, but not yet fully featured â€“ currently limited to executing assemblies stored as raw byte arrays in headers.

### Currently executed script is a simple `sanchez` spawner (clicking F6 spawns and places player into it) (source is in ExecutedResource.cs)

### Loaded scripts should be created just like you would make FiveM c# scripts, see: [FiveM docs](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/runtimes/csharp/)

## Features
- Execute managed C# assemblies from raw uint8_t[] blobs.
- Minimal API with clear extension points.

## Example Usage
Currently, execution works by embedding your assembly as raw bytes inside a header file:

```cpp
// Convert your C# assembly to a static uint8_t array
static std::vector<uint8_t> scriptData = std::vector<uint8_t>(
    std::begin(executed), 
    std::end(executed)
);

// Run the script
executor.Execute("test_script", scriptData);
```

## Building
The project uses **CMake** for cross-platform builds.
```sh
# Create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure
cmake ..
# or if using single-configuration generator
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

# Build
cmake --build . 
# or if using something like MSBuild/MSVC
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Generating header from assembly
Since execution requires embedding assemblies into headers, you can use the included `generate_header.py` script:
```sh
./generate_header.py <input_file> <output_header>
```
### Example:
```sh
./generate_header.py your_assembly.dll include/cse/executed.h
```

#### This will generate a C++ header containing
```cpp
const unsigned char executed[] = {
    0x4D, 0x5A, 0x90, 0x00, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x04, 0x00, 0x00, ...
};
```

## API reference
### Execute a script
```cpp
bool Executor::Execute(
    const std::string& scriptName,
    const std::vector<uint8_t>& scriptData,
    std::optional<std::reference_wrapper<std::vector<uint8_t>>> pdbData,
    std::optional<std::reference_wrapper<RuntimeInfo>> runtime
);
```
- **scriptName** -> doesn't really matter that much, used just internally
- **scriptData** -> vector containing raw bytes of the assembly
- **pdbData** (optional) -> you can include raw bytes of debug symbols if you want
- **runtime** (optional) -> if you want to execute in a specific runtime otherwise executes in the first available

Returns `true` on success `false` on failure

### Get available runtimes
```cpp
const std::vector<RuntimeInfo>& Executor::GetRuntimes();
```
Provides access to all registered runtimes.

### RuntimeInfo reference
```cpp
std::string RuntimeInfo::GetResourceName() const;
```
Returns a string containing name of the resource owning the runtime

## Extending
Right now, the executor only runs a single hardcoded script blob. (F6 to spawn a sanchez)

To extend functionality:
1. **Load assemblies from disk**
    - replace `scriptData` in `executor.Execute("test_script", scriptData);` with your loaded assembly
2. **Runtime selection**
    - add a selector based on resource name
    - pass the selected runtime into `executor.Execute("test_script", scriptData, std::nullopt, std::cref(runtime));`
